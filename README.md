# Calciulating-Pi-Through-Elastic-Collisions
This is a final project for my computational physics class in the Fall Semester of 2024. My partner and I took inspiration from 3Blue1Brown's video "The Most Unexpected Answer to a counting puzzle," which explores how two objects colliding with each other in an elastic setting can calculate pi. Using the conservation of energy and momentum formula, we were able to derive the velocity and dynamically plot the point using Matplotlib to showcase a circle after our collisions. We did everything from scratch but the graphics. Although this method is highly inefficient, it is a fun project.
